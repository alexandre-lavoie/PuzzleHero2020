4/5

WARNING The Resistance seems to have hacked our systems. The infrastructure is currently being stabilized.

With the introduction of the prohibition of code, the government has established a public reporting system for violators. However, the number of reported violators is ridiculously larger than the number of people hired to handle the reported cases...

Help us identify the suspects from the alleged descriptions. Establish a connection (for instance, with Netcat) to :

ip: 167.99.191.188 port: 6343

A description of the suspects has been received, you must give us the offenders' names.

Ask the value of one of the reported traits, for instance:

eyes

Or give us the person's name so that we can go and arrest them:

John Smith

Technology usage in government having been limited, so you have a maximum number of attempts... Make good use of them!
